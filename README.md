# Advent of Code 2025 - Spec-Driven Development

This repository explores **spec-driven development** for solving Advent of Code 2025 puzzles using AI agents.

## Approach

Instead of directly solving problems, this project uses a spec-driven workflow:

1. **Write a Specification**: For each day's puzzle, create a detailed specification in `specs/`
2. **Assign to AI Agent**: Use the spec to assign the implementation to an AI agent (via Opencode)
3. **Review & Iterate**: Review the AI-generated solution and refine as needed

## Directory Structure

```
aoc-2025/
├── specs/          # Problem specifications for each day
├── solutions/      # Implemented solutions (generated by AI agents)
├── templates/      # Templates for specs and solutions
└── .opencode/      # Configuration for Opencode agent manager
```

## Getting Started

### Creating a New Spec

Use the spec template to create a specification for a day's puzzle:

```bash
cp templates/spec-template.md specs/day-XX.md
```

Edit the spec file to include:
- Problem description
- Input/output examples
- Expected behavior
- Constraints and edge cases

### Assigning to an AI Agent

Once you have a spec, you can assign it to an AI agent using Opencode:

```bash
opencode assign specs/day-XX.md
```

### Directory Convention

- `specs/day-01.md` through `specs/day-25.md` - Daily puzzle specifications
- `solutions/day-01/` through `solutions/day-25/` - Solution implementations

## Workflow Example

1. Read the Advent of Code puzzle for the day
2. Write a detailed spec in `specs/day-XX.md`
3. Assign the spec to an AI agent
4. Review and test the generated solution
5. Iterate if needed

## Why Spec-Driven Development?

- **Clarity**: Forces clear thinking about the problem before implementation
- **Delegation**: Enables effective collaboration with AI agents
- **Documentation**: Serves as living documentation of problem requirements
- **Learning**: Helps understand how well AI agents can interpret specifications
