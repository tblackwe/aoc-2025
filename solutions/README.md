# Solutions Directory

This directory contains the implemented solutions for each day's puzzle.

## Structure

Each day has its own subdirectory:

```
solutions/
├── day-01/
│   ├── solution.py       # Main solution implementation
│   ├── test_solution.py  # Test cases
│   ├── input.txt         # Your puzzle input (not committed)
│   └── README.md         # Notes about the solution
├── day-02/
│   └── ...
└── day-25/
    └── ...
```

## Running a Solution

```bash
cd solutions/day-01
python3 solution.py
```

## Running Tests

```bash
cd solutions/day-01
python3 -m unittest test_solution.py
```

## AI-Generated Solutions

Solutions in this directory are primarily generated by AI agents based on specifications from the `specs/` directory. Each solution should:

- Follow the template structure
- Include comprehensive tests
- Have clear documentation
- Handle edge cases from the spec

## Language Choice

While Python is used in the templates, you can use any language you prefer. Just ensure:
- The spec clearly indicates the language preference
- Tests are included for that language
- The solution structure is consistent
