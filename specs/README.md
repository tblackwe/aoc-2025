# Specifications Directory

This directory contains the problem specifications for each day of Advent of Code 2025.

## Creating a Spec

Use the template from `../templates/spec-template.md` to create a new specification:

```bash
cp ../templates/spec-template.md day-01.md
```

## Spec Guidelines

A good specification should include:

1. **Clear Problem Description**: Explain what needs to be solved in plain language
2. **Input/Output Format**: Define exactly what the input looks like and what output is expected
3. **Examples**: Provide at least 2-3 worked examples with explanations
4. **Edge Cases**: List potential edge cases that need to be handled
5. **Constraints**: Any performance or implementation constraints
6. **Test Cases**: Specific test cases with expected results

## Naming Convention

- Use `day-01.md` through `day-25.md` for daily puzzles
- Use two-digit numbers with leading zeros (e.g., `day-01`, not `day-1`)

## Best Practices

- Write specs **before** looking at solutions or hints
- Be specific about data types and formats
- Include both simple and complex examples
- Think through edge cases early
- Update specs if you discover ambiguities during implementation
