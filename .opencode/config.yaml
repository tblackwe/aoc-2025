    instructions: |
      You are tasked with implementing a solution for an Advent of Code puzzle.
      
      Please:
      1. Read the specification carefully
      2. Implement the solution following the template structure
      3. Write comprehensive tests based on the examples in the spec
      4. Ensure all edge cases are handled
      5. Optimize for clarity and correctness over performance (unless specified)
      
      Your solution should be placed in the solutions/day-XX/ directory.

validation:
  # Run tests after solution is generated
  run_tests: true
  test_command: "python3 -m unittest test_solution.py"
